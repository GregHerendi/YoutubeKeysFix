# Youtube key shortcuts FIX


Youtube player controls will work consistently after page load and after clicking controls:
- Space (play/pause), F (fullscreen), M (mute), Left (jump backwards), Right (jump forwards), Up (volume up), Down (volume down)

Press ESC to switch between player and webpage mode. PageDown also switches to webpage mode.
Click outside movie frame to get standard page controls: Space (page down), Up, Down, Left, Right (scroll)

Fixes the following awkward behaviour of Youtube player controls after clicking them (making the individual control focused):
- after clicking the mute button Space toggles mute instead of pausing
- after clicking the volume slider Left-Right will change the volume instead of stepping the video.
- after clicking subtitle button Space will toggle subtitles
- after clicking settings button Space will toggle settings
